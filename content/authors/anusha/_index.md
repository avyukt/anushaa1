I am a recent graduate from the Applied Statistics professional studies program at the Cornell University.  I love learning from big messy data and gather insights from rigorous statistical analysis to inform decision making under uncertainty. Prior to this, I was working at a policy think tank to build models that can help predict and explain economic movements at different time horizons. I am keen to explore approaches in statistical machine learning which go beyond predictions using past data and adapt to the radical uncertainty and changes in the complex systems.
